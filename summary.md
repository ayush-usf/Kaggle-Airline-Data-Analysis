# Summary:

After analyzing the data, a lot of insights have been generated. Most of the delays and cancellations are due to three major reasons:
- Weather
- Airline/Carrier Issues
- National Air System


If answers to such questions could be answered, this might help governments, airport authorities, airline organizations, or third party businesses who provide services on platforms built by airport and airline industries like advertising agencies and infotainment system providers to make smart decisions while providing any service to customers.
The government could choose locations with the least delaying/ canceling factors to build the busiest airport in their country. With more footfall on such airports, airport authorities could make more revenue allowing more and more airlines willing to land their flights at such a big airport. With such humongous/ mammoth footfall advertising agencies could throw more advertisements to customers.
